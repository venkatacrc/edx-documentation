The User Retirement Driver Scripts
**********************************

Tubular (`edx/tubular on github <https://github.com/edx/tubular>`_) is a
repository of Python 3 scripts designed to plug into various automation
tooling.  Among them are two scripts intended to drive the user retirement
workflow.

``scripts/get_learners_to_retire.py``
    Generates a list of users that are ready for immediate retirement.  Users
    are "ready" after a certain number of days spent in the ``PENDING`` state,
    specified by the ``--cool_off_days`` argument.  Produces an output intended
    for consumption by Jenkins in order to spawn separate downstream builds for
    each user.
``scripts/retire_one_learner.py``
    Retires the user specified by the ``--username`` argument.

These two scripts share a required ``--config_file`` argument, which specifies
the driver configuration file for your environment (e.g., production).  This
configuration file is a YAML file that contains LMS auth secrets, API URLs,
and retirement pipeline stages specific to that environment.  For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   client_id: <client ID for the retirement service user>
   client_secret: <client secret for the retirement service user>

   base_urls:
       lms: https://courses.example.com/
       ecommerce: https://ecommerce.example.com/
       credentials: https://credentials.example.com/

   retirement_pipeline:
       - ['RETIRING_EMAIL_LISTS', 'EMAIL_LISTS_COMPLETE', 'LMS', 'retirement_retire_mailings']
       - ['RETIRING_ENROLLMENTS', 'ENROLLMENTS_COMPLETE', 'LMS', 'retirement_unenroll']
       - ['RETIRING_LMS_MISC', 'LMS_MISC_COMPLETE', 'LMS', 'retirement_lms_retire_misc']
       - ['RETIRING_LMS', 'LMS_COMPLETE', 'LMS', 'retirement_lms_retire']

The ``client_id`` and ``client_secret`` keys contain the oauth credentials
which are simply copied from the output of the ``create_dot_application``
management command outlined in :ref:`retirement-service-user`.

The ``base_urls`` section defines the mappings of IDA to base URLs used by the
scripts to construct API URLs.  Only the LMS is mandatory here, but if any of
your pipeline states contain API calls to other services, they must
also be present in the ``base_urls`` section.

The ``retirement_pipeline`` section defines the steps, state names, and order
of execution for each environment.  Each item is a list in the form of:

#. start state name
#. end state name
#. IDA to call against (LMS, ECOMMERCE, or CREDENTIALS currently)
#. method name to call in Tubular's
   `edx_api.py <https://github.com/edx/tubular/blob/master/tubular/edx_api.py>`_

For example: ``['RETIRING_CREDENTIALS', 'CREDENTIALS_COMPLETE', 'CREDENTIALS',
'retire_learner']`` will set the user's state to ``RETIRING_CREDENTIALS``, call
a pre-instantiated ``retire_learner`` method in the CredentialsApi, then set
the user's state to ``CREDENTIALS_COMPLETE``.

Examples
--------

The following are some examples of how to use the driver scripts.

Setup your execution environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/edx/tubular.git
   cd tubular
   virtualenv --python=`which python3` venv
   source venv/bin/activate

Generate a list of learners that are ready for retirement (those learners who
have selected and confirmed account deletion and have been in the ``PENDING``
state for the time specified ``cool_off_days``).

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir learners_to_retire
   scripts/get_learners_to_retire.py \
       --config_file=path/to/config.yml \
       --output_dir=learners_to_retire \
       --cool_off_days=5

The ``learners_to_retire`` directory now contains several INI files, each
containing a single line in the form of ``USERNAME=<username-of-learner>``.
Iterate over these files while executing the ``retire_one_learner.py`` on each
learner:

.. code-block:: bash

   scripts/retire_one_learner.py \
       --config_file=path/to/config.yml \
       --username=<username-of-learner-to-retire>


Using the Driver Scripts in an Automated Framework
**************************************************

At edX we call the user retirement scripts from
`Jenkins <https://jenkins.io/>`_ jobs on one of our internal Jenkins
services.  The user retirement driver scripts are intended to be agnostic,
about which automation framework you use, but they were only fully tested
from Jenkins.

For more information about how we execute these scripts at edX, see the
following wiki articles:

* `User Retirement Jenkins Implementation <https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PLAT/pages/704872737/User+Retirement+Jenkins+Implementation>`_
* `How to: retirement Jenkins jobs development and testing <https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PLAT/pages/698221444/How+to+retirement+Jenkins+jobs+development+and+testing>`_

And check out the Groovy DSL files we use to seed these jobs:

* `platform/jobs/RetirementJobs.groovy in edx/jenkins-job-dsl <https://github.com/edx/jenkins-job-dsl/blob/master/platform/jobs/RetirementJobs.groovy>`_
* `platform/jobs/RetirementJobEdxTriggers.groovy in edx/jenkins-job-dsl <https://github.com/edx/jenkins-job-dsl/blob/master/platform/jobs/RetirementJobEdxTriggers.groovy>`_
